<pre>## Betting Unit Allocations

### Matchup: [CRICKET] Yorkshire vs Lancashire ‚Äî 2025-07-11T18:00:00Z
- **Suggested Bet:** Bet on Lancashire to win
- **Confidence Score:** 7
- **Unit Size:** 1 Unit
- **Rationale:** Lancashire has demonstrated strong recent form, particularly with their batting line-up achieving scores consistently over 300+. Despite Yorkshire‚Äôs home advantage and robust bowling attack, Headingley‚Äôs pitch conditions, which favor pace and seam, might slightly benefit Yorkshire. However, Lancashire‚Äôs overall stronger form, especially if they bat first, tips the balance in their favor.

### Matchup: [SOCCER] Central C√≥rdoba vs Aldosivi Mar del Plata ‚Äî 2025-07-11T18:30:00Z
- **Suggested Bet:** Bet on Under 2.5 goals
- **Confidence Score:** 6
- **Unit Size:** 0.5 Units
- **Rationale:** Both teams are known to struggle with scoring, as evidenced by their involvement in numerous low-scoring matches. Their defensive stats, although not perfect, indicate a likelihood of a game where defenses outperform attacks.

- **Suggested Bet:** Bet on Cork City to win
- **Confidence Score:** 7
- **Unit Size:** 1 Unit
