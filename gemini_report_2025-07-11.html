## Unit Size Allocation Based on Confidence Scores

To determine appropriate unit sizes for potential bets on the MLB matchups set for July 11, 2025, weâ€™ll employ the given confidence score range of 60-70%. The unit sizes will be scaled to represent the level of confidence in the analysis, with higher confidence warranting larger unit sizes.

### Confidence and Unit Size Mapping

- **60-65% Confidence**: Moderate confidence level.
  - **Unit Size**: 1-2 units.
  - **Strategy**: Focus on smaller, diverse bets such as Over/Under totals where statistical trends may offer some insight but acknowledge possible variance.

- **66-70% Confidence**: Higher confidence level.
  - **Unit Size**: 3-4 units.
  - **Strategy**: More aggressive betting on identified value plays such as money line favorites or player performance props with strong historical backing.

### Application

1. **Betting the Over/Under**:
   - **60-65% confidence**: Utilize 1-2 units for predictions on run totals, particularly in games involving average pitching against powerful offenses or strong pitchers against weaker lineups.
   - **66-70% confidence**: Allocate 3-4 units in games with clear historical trends suggesting a strong tendency toward over or under.

2. **Futures or Props**:
   - **60-65% confidence**: Apply 1-2 units on broader outcome categories like division winners, where long-term performance patterns support these selections.
   - **66-70% confidence**: Invest 3-4 units in more specific props with historical analysis supporting player awards or milestone achievements.

### Summary

This unit size allocation is designed to manage risk in scenarios where the confidence score doesnâ€™t reach the high assurance required for maximum unit investments. The variance in confidence levels dictates a conservative to moderately aggressive betting approach, reserving higher stakes for scenarios with supporting historical data and potential predictive advantages.

Sector adjustments should be made as real-time data and team conditions become available closer to the game date, ensuring responsiveness to dynamic factors such as injuries or lineup changes.
