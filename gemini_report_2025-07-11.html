        <h2>Official Daily Slate: 2025-07-11</h2>
<pre>To assign unit sizes based on confidence scores derived from an MLB matchup analysis, follow this structured markdown slate format. This approach allows you to systematically assign risk based on your confidence in the analysis.

### Unit Size Allocation Based on Confidence Scores:

#### Executive Summary:
- **Objective**: Utilize confidence scores to determine unit sizes for betting on MLB games scheduled for July 11, 2025.
- **Method**: Assign unit sizes proportionally to the confidence scores to manage risk effectively.

#### Confidence Score to Unit Size Guide:

| Confidence Score | Unit Size Recommendation |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| **9-10**         | 3 Units                  |
| **7-8**          | 2 Units                  |
| **5-6**          | 1.5 Units                |
| **3-4**          | 1 Unit                   |
| **1-2**          | 0.5 Units                |

#### Example Analysis and Betting Recommendation:

1. **Matchup**: Team A vs. Team B
   - **Confidence Score**: 8/10
   - **Rationale**: Team A has a superior home record and a starting pitcher in excellent form. Team B is dealing with injuries and has a poor road performance.

2. **Recommended Bets**:
   - **Moneyline on Team A**: 2 Units
   - **Under on Total Runs**: 1.5 Units

3. **Additional Insights**:
   - Consider increased unit size for props on Team A‚Äôs pitcher strikeouts due to favorable matchup statistics.

#### Guidelines for Execution:
- **Research and Analysis**: Continuously update and refine your analytics model based on the latest data available.
- **Risk Management**: Adjust unit sizes based on changes in lineups, injuries, and any unforeseen developments as game day approaches.
- **Diversification**: Spread your bets across different types of wagers (e.g., moneyline, totals, props) to mitigate risk.

#### Conclusion:
Apply this structured approach to efficiently utilize confidence scores, aligning your betting strategy with the current statistical and situational insights for each matchup. Remember to balance data-driven decision making with situational awareness for optimal outcomes.</pre>
