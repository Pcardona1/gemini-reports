# Unit Sizes Based on Confidence Scores

- **New York Yankees vs Chicago Cubs**
  - **Confidence Score:** 75%
  - **Unit Size:** 3 units  
  - **Rationale:** With a relatively high confidence score, allocate a moderate unit size. The Yankees' potential home advantage and historical performance should provide strong backing unless significant lineup changes occur.

- **Cincinnati Reds vs Colorado Rockies**
  - **Confidence Score:** 70%
  - **Unit Size:** 2.5 units  
  - **Rationale:** A slightly lower confidence, factoring in the challenges of Coors Field. The Reds' proficiency in hitting and favorable pitching matchups justify a moderate unit commitment.

- **Baltimore Orioles vs Miami Marlins**
  - **Confidence Score:** 65%
  - **Unit Size:** 2 units  
  - **Rationale:** With the potential for volatility, a cautious approach is warranted. The Orioles' and Marlins' recent performances necessitate a conservative investment.

- **Detroit Tigers vs Seattle Mariners**
  - **Confidence Score:** 60%
  - **Unit Size:** 1.5 units  
  - **Rationale:** This game features uncertainty, meriting a lower unit size. Both teams have shown inconsistent form, indicating a close matchup.

- **Chicago White Sox vs Cleveland Guardians**
  - **Confidence Score:** 75%
  - **Unit Size:** 3 units  
  - **Rationale:** Similar to the Yankees game, a 75% confidence encourages a solid bet. Divisional implications and the Guardians' balanced roster suggest a favorable outcome for the Guardians if key players are active.

> **Note:** Ensure to reassess all factors, including player status and recent team dynamics, before placing bets. These unit sizes serve as guidance based on preliminary confidence assessments.
